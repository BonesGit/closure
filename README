Installation
============
./autogen.sh
[./configure --help] (to get/set optional configure settings)
make
make install (as root)

	Installation Notes:
	------------------
	1) Even though the configure script prints out the following:

	   Using $(sysconfdir)/gconf/schemas as install directory for schema files

	   The path used is always /etc/gconf/schemas. I'm not sure how to change 
	   this printout message yet ;)


Troubleshooting
===============

1) If you are getting any GConf errors when attempting to run Closure, please
double check that the gconf closure schema was installed successfully. You
can use gcond-editor to check this. If the schema needs to be installed
execute the following command from the root closure dir:
	gconftool-2 --install-schema-file=src/closure.schemas
